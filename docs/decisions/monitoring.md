# Teacher monitoring view

Part of the [Product & UX Decisions](../../DECISIONS.md) index — one file per
area. Entries are newest-first; add new ones at the top, and add a matching line
to the index in the same change. Replaced decisions move to Superseded at the
bottom of this file.

### Teacher chat cards: collapsed to the last 5 lines, End chat asks first

_2026-07-12_

**Decision:** On the teacher's monitoring view, each chat renders as a card that is
**collapsed by default**, showing only the last 5 lines. One button toggles between
expanding to the full chat and minimizing back. **End chat** goes through the same
confirmation step the student side uses (with teacher-appropriate copy), even though the
brief only asked for a button — the product owner has since confirmed the confirmation
step should stay. Completed chats reuse the exact same card in a muted,
slightly desaturated look, keep expand/minimize, and lose the End chat button.

**Why:** A teacher watches many chats at once — the newest lines are what matter while
monitoring, and short cards keep the grid scannable. Ending a chat kicks real students
out of their conversation and can't be undone, so one stray tap on a busy grid shouldn't
do it. Completed chats stay on the grid (muted rather than removed) so the teacher can
still review what was said.

_Implemented in [ChatCard](../../client/src/components/Teacher/ChatCard/index.tsx)._

### Teacher view: character colors follow participant order

_2026-07-12_

**Decision:** Teacher chat cards color character names from the same `--char-*` palette
as the student chatbox, assigned by **participant order within each chat** (first student
listed is green, the 2nd golden, and so on). There is no "green = you" rule here because
the teacher isn't a participant.

**Why:** Reuses the learnable palette without inventing a second system. Colors are
per-card: the same character can get a different color on two cards, which is fine — the
teacher reads one card at a time, and per-card distinctness beats global consistency
(the same trade-off as the viewer-relative
[Character-name colors](chat-behavior.md#character-name-colors) rule).

_Assignment happens in [ChatCard](../../client/src/components/Teacher/ChatCard/index.tsx) via
[characterColor.ts](../../client/src/lib/characterColor.ts)._
